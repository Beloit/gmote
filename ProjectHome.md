> Gmote turns Android into a remote control for a computer, allowing users to run movies and music at a distance. It supports all of the standard remote control features such as play, pause, rewind, volume controls etc. It also has a built-in file browser that lets you select what to play. Some typical use-cases are people launching and controlling movies while sitting back on their couch, or listening to music.

> It also has a touch pad feature which allows you to control your mouse from the phone, similar to a laptop touchpad (also sending keystrokes typed in on the phone to the computer). It's great for sitting back on the couch while watching youtube or hulu.

> Version 2.0 also has a Gmote Stream feature which allows you to stream music from your computer to your phone!

> It supports Mac, Windows and Linux.
